# CONTRIBUTING

## Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

* YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
* NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

## Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

## Pull request process

* We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
* Look at the Continuous Integration build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
* We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
Please use [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to apply these styles with `air format`
but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.
* We use [roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/).  
* We use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.  
* For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
