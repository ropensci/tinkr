Only the body of the (R) Markdown file is cast to XML, using the Commonmark specification via the [`commonmark` package](https://github.com/r-lib/commonmark). 
Frontmatter metadata can be stored in the YAML, TOML or JSON format.
YAML-formatted metadata could be edited using the [`yaml` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=yaml), 
JSON-formatted metadata could be edited using the [`jsonlite` package](https://jeroen.r-universe.dev/jsonlite).
which is not the goal of this package.

We have created an [R6 class](https://r6.r-lib.org/) object called **yarn** to store the representation of both the frontmatter and the XML data, both of which are accessible through the `$body` and `$frontmatter` elements. 
The field called `$frontmatter_format` contains the format of the metadata (YAML, TOML, or JSON).
In addition, the namespace prefix is set to "md" in the `$ns` element.

You can perform XPath queries using the `$body` and `$ns` elements:

```{r}
library("tinkr")
library("xml2")
path <- system.file("extdata", "example1.md", package = "tinkr")
head(readLines(path))
ex1 <- tinkr::yarn$new(path)
# find all ropensci.org blog links
xml_find_all(
  x = ex1$body, 
  xpath = ".//md:link[contains(@destination,'ropensci.org/blog')]", 
  ns = ex1$ns
)
```
