Description: Parsing '(R)Markdown' files with numerous regular expressions can
    be fraught with peril, but it does not have to be this way. Converting
    '(R)Markdown' files to 'XML' using the 'commonmark' package allows
    in-memory editing via of 'markdown' elements via 'XPath' through the
    extensible 'R6' class called 'yarn'. These modified 'XML' representations
    can be written to '(R)Markdown' documents via an 'xslt' stylesheet which
    implements an extended version of 'GitHub'-flavoured 'markdown' so that you
    can tinker to your hearts content.
