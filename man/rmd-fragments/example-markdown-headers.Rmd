This is a basic example. 
We read "example1.md", change all headers 3 to headers 1, and save it back to md. 
Because the xml2 objects are [passed by reference](https://blog.penjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/pass-by-reference-vs-pass-by-value-animation.gif), manipulating them does not require reassignment. 

```{r}
library("magrittr")
library("tinkr")
# From Markdown to XML
path <- system.file("extdata", "example1.md", package = "tinkr")
# Level 3 header example:
cat(tail(readLines(path, 40)), sep = "\n")
ex1  <- tinkr::yarn$new(path)
# transform level 3 headers into level 1 headers
ex1$body %>%
  xml2::xml_find_all(xpath = ".//md:heading[@level='3']", ex1$ns) %>% 
  xml2::xml_set_attr("level", 1)

# Back to Markdown
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = "md")
ex1$write(tmp)
# Level three headers are now Level one:
cat(tail(readLines(tmp, 40)), sep = "\n")
unlink(tmp)
```
